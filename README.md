# odin_landing_page_project
The Odin Project's project on creating a web page.

I will be using this readme file to credit any photos I include on my landing page.

Cyndi came up with a great idea: make this page the Blupee Conservation Society.
She has already done a lot of design work for the logo, I will be using the color pallette she uses.
